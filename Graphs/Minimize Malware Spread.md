## Minimize Malware Spread

In a network of nodes, each node i is directly connected to another node j if and only if graph[i][j] = 1.

Some nodes **initial** are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose **M(initial)** is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

**We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed, would minimize M(initial).  If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.**  

Note that if a node was removed from the initial list of infected nodes, it may still be infected later as a result of the malware spread.

### Example 1:
```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]
Output: 0
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

> **Note:**   
> The result may be very large, so 1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300  
> 0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1  
> graph[i][i] == 1  
> 1 <= initial.length <= graph.length  
> 0 <= initial[i] < graph.lengthyou need to return a string instead of an integer.  


 ### Solutioning:
First, let's find a component of the graph using a depth first search.  

Afterwards, notice that if two nodes in initial belong to the same component, then removing them from initial won't decrease M(initial). This is because the malware will spread to reach every node in this component no matter what.

So, among the components with a unique node in initial, we will remove the node with the largest component size. (If there's a tie, we return the smallest index.)  

Also, if there isn't any component with a unique node in initial, then we'll just return the smallest index node.

        int size = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int index = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        Set<Integer> globalVisited = new HashSet();
        
        Set<Integer> initialSet = new HashSet(Arrays.stream(initial)
                                .mapToObj(Integer::new).collect(Collectors.toList()));
                
        for(int i=0;i<initial.length;i++){
            if(!globalVisited.contains(initial[i])){

                connectedComponent(graph, initial[i], visited);
                globalVisited.addAll(visited);
                
                int compSize = visited.size();

                        size = compSize;
                    }else if(compSize == size){
                        index = Math.min(initial[i], index);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
         
        if(index == Integer.MAX_VALUE){
            for(int i=0;i<initial.length;i++){
                index = Math.min(index, initial[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return index;

      private static void connectedComponent(int[][] graph, int src, Set<Integer> visited){
        visited.add(src);

        int[] adj = graph[src];
        for(int i=0;i<adj.length;i++){
          int dest = i;
          if(adj[i] == 1 && !visited.contains(dest)){
            connectedComponent(graph, dest, visited);
          }
        }
      }
}
```  
**Time Complexity:** O(N<sup>2</sup>) where N is the length of graph, as the graph is given in adjacent matrix form.  

**Space Complexity:** O(N)
